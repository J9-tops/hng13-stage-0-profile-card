      <h2>My Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Jimmy Smart, a passionate frontend developer with a deep love for creating 
        beautiful, accessible, and user-friendly web experiences. My journey into web development 
        began with a curiosity about how websites work, and it quickly evolved into a full-blown 
        passion for crafting digital solutions that make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern UI frameworks, always staying up-to-date 
        with the latest technologies and best practices. When I'm not coding, you'll find me 
        playing chess or exploring new programming paradigms. I believe that continuous learning 
        is the key to growth, and I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my skills.

      <h2>Areas Where I Need to Build Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is crucial for growth. While I'm confident in many areas, I recognize 
        there are aspects where I need to build more confidence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Backend Development</h3>
          <p>
            While I'm comfortable with frontend technologies, I sometimes feel less confident 
            when working with backend systems and databases. I want to develop a fuller 
            understanding of the full-stack landscape.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Public Speaking and Presentations</h3>
          <p>
            Presenting my work to large groups or speaking at tech meetups can be nerve-wracking. 
            I'm working on building this confidence through practice and exposure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>System Design and Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Designing scalable systems from scratch requires a deep understanding of architectural 
            patterns. This is an area I'm actively learning about and want to strengthen.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Debugging Complex Issues</h3>
          <p>
            When faced with particularly challenging bugs, especially in unfamiliar codebases, 
            I sometimes struggle with where to start. I'm developing better debugging strategies 
            and learning to approach problems more systematically.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
      <div class="future-note">
        <p>Dear Future Jimmy,</p>
        <p>
          I hope when you read this, you're looking back with pride at how far you've come. 
          Remember this momentâ€”the excitement, the nervousness, and the determination you feel 
          right now. These feelings are valid and they're what drive growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          You chose this path because you believe in yourself and your ability to make an impact 
          through technology. The challenges you face are not roadblocks; they're stepping stones 
          to becoming the developer you aspire to be. Every bug you debug, every line of code you 
          write, and every collaboration you engage in is building your expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget to celebrate small wins along the way. Progress isn't always linear, and 
          that's okay. What matters is that you keep showing up, keep learning, and keep pushing 
          yourself outside your comfort zone. The skills you're building now will serve you for 
          years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay curious, stay humble, and never stop learning. The tech industry moves fast, but 
          so do you. Trust the process, believe in your abilities, and remember why you started 
          this journey. You've got this!
        </p>
        <p>With determination and optimism,<br>Present-day Jimmy</p>

      <h2>Extra Thoughts and Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond my technical aspirations, I believe strongly in the power of community and 
        giving back. I'm passionate about mentoring beginners and helping them navigate 
        the sometimes overwhelming world of web development. I've seen firsthand how a 
        supportive community can transform someone's learning journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also believe that the best developers are those who combine technical excellence 
        with empathy and understanding. Technology should serve people, and every line of 
        code we write should be done with the end user in mind. This human-centered approach 
        guides my work and my interactions with teammates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie at the intersection of 
        web development and emerging technologies. Whether it's AI integration, progressive 
        web apps, or new frameworks that haven't been invented yet, I'm ready to embrace 
        the future of web development with open arms and an eager mind.
